          We started Blashio with a vision to give more options to the people
          who looks for the beauticians, salons, makeup artists, and settle by
          choosing less optimal options, many times, because of less options of
          professionals. Either they find the salons, parlours, artists,
          beauticians nearby them or through previous connections. What we do
          for them, is that, we provide the entire list of salons, beauty
          parlours, makeup artists, beauticians with all details. So that the
          people could get the details of them near them. And could appoint the
          professionals as per best of their choice.
          <br></br>Another problem is that the beauticians, professionals,
          makeup artists, parolours get only limited clients which come to them
          either offline or through previous connections. So, most of the time,
          their land up making loss to their work and business by remaining
          idle, because of no appointments or limited appointments. We provide
          such business owners, freelancers, artists, beauticians, makeup
          artists more opportunities to get and attract the client with their
          services. So that their business could grow better.
